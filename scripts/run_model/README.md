# run_model

This directory contains the execution scripts for the diverse models we profiled in the paper. Each script launches the model training with the configurations from their original paper. 

## /one_gpu

This subdirectory contains the execution scripts to launch the model training on a single GPU.

## /multi_gpu

This subdirectory contains the execution scripts to launch the model training on multiple GPUs. Default is two GPUs on a same machine, but you would be able to alter the number of GPUs and machines involved with ease.
